Intentionally taking into account the different cultures and values of the parent company and its subsidiaries is very important. For instance, a global conglomerate such as the Virgin Group consists of multiple subsidiaries with unique cultures and identities. Therefore, group website aims to reflect each company's culture, values, and mission while remaining consistent with the overall Virgin Group brand.

Additionally, we strongly believe that highlighting the corporate social responsibility initiatives of the company can enhance users' trust and credibility. For example, the Coca-Cola Company has a dedicated subsite that emphasizes their sustainability initiatives. By demonstrating the company's commitment to environmental and social responsibility, the website can enhance the company's overall reputation and credibility.

### 5 Elements of a User-friendly Corporate Group Website

In today's digital age, our company's website serves as our virtual storefront. A corporate group website is no different. However, designing a user-friendly corporate group website can be a challenge, especially if there are multiple subsidiaries involved. In this blog post, we'll explore some best practices for designing a user-friendly corporate group website that provides a seamless user experience.

#### 1 - Simplify Navigation

The first step to designing a user-friendly corporate group website is to simplify navigation. Users should be able to find the information they need quickly and easily. We should use a clear and intuitive navigation menu that organizes pages by category or topic. Also, we must ensure that the menu is accessible on all pages of the website.

#### 2 - Ensure Consistency Across All Subsidiaries

Consistency is key when it comes to designing a user-friendly corporate group website. All subsidiaries should have a consistent design and layout. This makes it easy for users to navigate from one subsidiary website to another. We must use the same color scheme, font style, and layout across all subsidiaries.

#### 3 - Create a Simple and Clear Homepage

The homepage of a corporate group website should be simple and clear. Users should be able to understand what the website is about at a glance. We should use a hero image or video to showcase our company's products or services. We should include a clear call-to-action (CTA) that directs users to the next step, such as "Explore Our Products" or "Learn More About Us".

#### 4 - Optimize for Mobile

More and more people are accessing websites on their mobile devices. Therefore, it's essential to optimize our corporate group website for mobile. We should use responsive design to ensure that the website looks good on all devices. We should also make sure that the menu is easy to access and that the website loads quickly on mobile.

#### 5 - Use High-Quality Images and Videos

High-quality images and videos can help to engage users and make the website more visually appealing. We should use high-quality images and videos that showcase our company's products or services. This can help to create a positive impression of our company and encourage users to explore the website further.

Designing a user-friendly corporate group website requires careful planning and attention to detail. By simplifying navigation, ensuring consistency across all subsidiaries, creating a simple and clear homepage, optimizing for mobile, and using high-quality images and videos, we can create a website that provides a seamless user experience and encourages users to engage with our company further.
