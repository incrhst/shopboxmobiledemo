title: Booking and Appointment Services
f_post-summary: >-
  Recently, we compared several booking platforms to determine the best fit for
  a project we worked on. Note that some of these are less common. We needed a
  system that could both do standard appointments but also handle events. We
  have compiled the results in a comparison table which we've shared in this
  article.
